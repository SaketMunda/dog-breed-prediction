# Dog Breed Prediction
Deep learning model for predicting dog breed using Tensor Flow Hub

## About

This is a beginner level project on TensorFlow and TensorFlow hub to understand the concepts and workflow of DeepLearning Models using Unstructured data.

### Steps Involved

- 

### Libraries & Workspace 

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Hub
- TensorBoard Magic Function (for visualizing logs)
- Image Classfication Model ([mobilenet_v2](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_130_224/classification/5)) for Transfer Learning

### Dataset

[Download from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification)

### To Do

- [ ] Create a confusion matrix with our models predictions and true labels
